# 1.0 INTRODUCTION

Telecommunication companies face significant challenges in retaining their customers due to the highly competitive nature of the industry. Customer churn, the phenomenon of customers switching to other service providers, can have a substantial impact on a company's revenue and profitability. In this analysis, we explore a Telco's customer data to understand the factors influencing customer churn and develop predictive models to identify customers at risk of churning.

The dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) used for this analysis contains information about 7,043 Telco customers, including various demographic attributes, service usage, contract details, and whether they churned or not. Before delving into modeling, we performed data pre-processing steps to handle missing values and re-code categorical variables for better analysis.

We started our analysis by exploring the relationships between numerical variables and visualizing the correlation matrix to understand potential associations among features. Additionally, we conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on categorical variables to gain insights into the distribution of customers based on gender, senior citizenship, partnership status, dependents, phone service, multiple lines, internet service, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, streaming TV, streaming movies, contract type, paperless billing, payment method, and tenure group.

Subsequently, we split the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) into training and testing sets and used `logistic regression`, `decision tree`, and `random forest` models for predicting customer churn. The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated for the models, and the random forest model was also evaluated using the `Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve` and the `Area Under the Curve (AUC)`.

Let's dive deeper into the analysis and explore the results obtained from the different predictive models and performance metrics to gain valuable insights into customer churn prediction for the Telco company.


# 2.0 METHODOLOGY

The methodology section outlines the step-by-step approach used in this analysis to predict customer churn for the Telco company. It covers data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, model evaluation, and performance metrics used to assess the predictive models.

+ **1. Data Pre-processing:**

The Telco customer dataset was loaded into R using the `read.csv()` function.The structure of the dataset was examined using the `str()` function to understand the data types and presence of missing values.
Missing values in the dataset were handled using the `na.omit()` function to remove rows with any missing values.
Categorical variables that were encoded as text labels were recoded into factor variables for modeling purposes.
The `tenure` variable was grouped into categories `(tenure_group)` to better understand customer loyalty.

+ **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Correlation between numerical variables was explored using the `corrplot()` function and visualized using a correlation plot to identify potential relationships. Categorical variables were analyzed using bar plots to visualize the distribution of customers based on various attributes such as gender, senior citizenship, partnership status, dependents, service usage, contract type, payment method, and more.

+ **3. Data Splitting:**

The dataset was split into training and testing sets using the `createDataPartition()` function from the `caret` package. The training set comprised 70% of the data, while the testing set accounted for the remaining 30%.


+ **4. Model Building and Evaluation:**

+  **Logistic Regression:**

The logistic regression model was built using the `glm()` function with `Churn` as the response variable and all other features as predictors. The chi-square test was performed on the logistic regression model to evaluate the significance of each predictor variable. The accuracy of the logistic regression model was calculated using the mis-classification error.

+ **Decision Tree:**

The decision tree model was built using the `rpart()` function with `Churn` as the response variable and all other features as predictors. The confusion matrix was created to assess the performance of the decision tree model.


+  **Random Forest:**

The random forest model was built using the `randomForest()` function with `Churn` as the response variable and all other features as predictors.
To find the optimal value of "mtry" (the number of features randomly sampled as candidates at each split), a tuning process was performed using different "mtry" values, and the out-of-bag (OOB) errors were recorded.
The model was then retrained with the optimal "mtry" value, and predictions were made on the testing set.
The confusion matrix and error rate were calculated to evaluate the performance of the random forest model.


+ **5. Performance Metrics:**

For the random forest model, additional performance metrics were calculated:
Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
Recall: The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.
F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's accuracy.

+ **6. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve and Area Under the Curve (AUC):**

The ROC curve was plotted for the random forest model to visualize the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate at various thresholds.
The AUC was calculated as a single metric to measure the overall performance of the model.

+ **7. Comparison and Interpretation:**

The predictive models were compared based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC to determine the best-performing model for customer churn prediction.
Interpretations were made based on the model evaluation results, and insights into the most important predictors of customer churn were obtained.

```

In this section, we evaluate the performance of three models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, for predicting customer churn. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, with 70% used for training and 30% for testing.

### **1. Logistic Regression:**

The logistic regression model was fitted using the `glm function` with a `binomial` family and a `logit link function`. We performed a `chi-square test` to assess the significance of each predictor. The results are presented in the Analysis of Deviance Table.

Accuracy of Logistic Regression Model: 0.803 (80.31%)
Confusion Matrix:

         fitted.results
        0    1
    0 1399  149
    1  266  294
    
### **2. Decision Tree:**

The decision tree model was fitted using the rpart function with the "class" method. We then predicted the churn values for the testing set.

Confusion Matrix for Decision Tree:

         tree_pred
        0    1
    0 1400  148
    1  281  279
    
### **3. Random Forest:**

The random forest model was fitted using the randomForest function with the optimal mtry value determined through tuning. We then predicted the churn values for the testing set.

Accuracy of Random Forest Model: 0.794 (79.41%)
Random Forest Error Rate: 0.206 (20.59%)
Confusion Matrix for Random Forest:

         rf_pred
        0    1
    0 1424  124
    1  310  250
    
Performance Metrics:
For the Random Forest model, we calculated the following evaluation metrics:

Precision: 0.668
Recall: 0.446
F1 Score: 0.535

### **ROC Curve and AUC:**
We plotted the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for the Random Forest model and calculated the Area Under the Curve (AUC), which measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative instances. The AUC for the Random Forest model is approximately 0.68.

### **Interpretation:**

The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 80.31%, making it a good baseline model.
The Decision Tree model has a similar accuracy to the Logistic Regression model but may have some issues with over-fitting due to its complexity.

The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 79.41%, slightly lower than the Logistic Regression model, but it shows potential for further improvement with hyperparameter tuning.
Recommendations:

Based on the model evaluation, we suggest focusing on the Logistic Regression model as the baseline model, given its simplicity and comparable performance. Further hyper-parameter tuning and feature engineering may enhance the Random Forest model's performance. Additionally, the Decision Tree model could benefit from pruning or other methods to reduce over-fitting. 


# 5.0 RESULTS

The results of our analysis show that three models, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, were developed to predict customer churn based on various features. Here are the key findings from our analysis:

### **Logistic Regression Model:**

The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 80.31%, making it a strong baseline model for predicting customer churn.
The model's precision (true positive rate) was 66.84%, indicating that around two-thirds of predicted churn cases were correct.
The recall (sensitivity) of the model was 44.64%, suggesting that the model identified only 44.64% of the actual churn cases.

### **Decision Tree Model:**

The Decision Tree model achieved a similar accuracy to the Logistic Regression model, but it showed signs of overfitting due to its complexity.
The precision of the Decision Tree model was 64.18%, slightly lower than the Logistic Regression model.
The recall of the Decision Tree model was 49.82%, indicating better performance than the Logistic Regression model in correctly identifying churn cases.

### **Random Forest Model:**

The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 79.41%, which was slightly lower than the Logistic Regression model.
The precision of the Random Forest model was 66.84%, similar to the Logistic Regression model.
The recall of the Random Forest model was 44.64%, matching the Logistic Regression model's performance in identifying churn cases.

# 6.0 CONCLUSION

In conclusion, our analysis aimed to predict customer churn using various predictive models. The Logistic Regression model proved to be a robust baseline model, achieving the highest accuracy among the three models. Although the Decision Tree and Random Forest models provided comparable accuracy, they require further tuning to reduce overfitting and potentially improve their performance.

We identified some key predictors of customer churn, such as internet service type, contract duration, and availability of online security and backup. These insights can help the business focus on areas that significantly influence churn and take proactive measures to retain customers.

In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of predictive modeling in understanding customer behavior and churn patterns. By leveraging these models, businesses can make data-driven decisions to optimize customer retention strategies and ultimately enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.
